HW 24 Get It While You Can
2021-10-26
Time Spent: 41 Min
DISCO: For while, you can write a lot of if statements to satisfy the tasks
you are trying to pull off beacuse it goes through all of them before it 
returns what you want it to return if all the other statements come out to 
be false. That is why I put the return as no match because it can keep 
going through it when it is false till it matches and returns heads.
QCC: Is while similar to if statements in its execution process?
Refactor V0 Mods: I used the coin java file given in class because the values
of the coins were given right next to the coins. Also it shows the counter, 
and the bias and does everything in a more organized manner.
